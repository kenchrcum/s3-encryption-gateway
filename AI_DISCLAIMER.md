# AI Usage, Verification & Open Source Philosophy

### 1. Generated via Collective Intelligence
Development of this software involved the use of AI accelerators and Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude, Cursor, Antigravity or OpenCode. We treat these tools as advanced pairing partners to accelerate the development process.

### 2. Verification Standard
We explicitly reject blind "vibe-coding." While the specific implementation details may be AI-generated, the intent and constraints of the system are human-defined. The code has been subjected to testing to verify it meets these constraints, ensuring the output is functional and safe within the broader project context.

### 3. The Open Source Covenant
We acknowledge that the AI models used to assist in this project were trained on the collective, often unpaid work of humanity. These include sources such as unlicensed books, Stack Overflow answers, Reddit discussions and other open-source repositories.
We view the output of these models as a "remix" of public human knowledge. Because this technology relies on the public commons, we believe the output belongs to the public commons. Therefore, this project is and will remain Open Source as a repayment of debt to the community that made the training data possible.

### 4. Disclaimer of Warranty
While this code has been rigorously tested and verified by human maintainers, it is provided "as is." The author provides no warranty of any kind, express or implied, regarding the software's performance, stability, or fitness for a particular purpose, consistent with the terms of the chosen Open Source license.
