# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Default `ReadTimeout` disabled** (#135 follow-up): the default 15-second
  `ReadTimeout` set a hard TCP connection deadline that fired mid-stream on
  large object downloads regardless of `WriteTimeout` settings.  `ReadTimeout`
  now defaults to `0` (disabled); `ReadHeaderTimeout` (10s) continues to guard
  against slow-loris attacks.  Helm values `config.server.readTimeout` and
  `config.server.writeTimeout` are both updated to `"0s"`.

- **Active streaming write-deadline refresh** (#135 follow-up): even when
  `WriteTimeout` is set to a non-zero value (either explicitly in config or
  via `SERVER_WRITE_TIMEOUT`), the gateway now extends the HTTP write deadline
  every `timeout/2` interval while bytes are actively flowing. This prevents
  long-running S3 object downloads from being killed mid-stream, regardless of
  the configured timeout value.

- **Network-error handling on standard encrypted GET path**: the non-MPU
  `GetObject` streaming path now also distinguishes network aborts from
  decryption failures and logs them at Warn level rather than Error, matching
  the MPU path introduced in 0.7.1.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- **MPU large-object restore timeout** (#135): the default 15-second HTTP
  `WriteTimeout` caused the server to abort TCP connections mid-stream when
  restoring large encrypted multipart-upload objects (e.g. CNPG backups with
  multi-part data). The default `WriteTimeout` is now disabled (0) so the
  gateway can stream arbitrarily large objects without artificial cut-offs.
  Operators who rely on a hard deadline can still set `write_timeout` in the
  server configuration. (Note: `ReadTimeout` also required disabling — see 0.7.2.)

- **Misleading tamper-detection log on network errors**: when a client
  disconnect or network timeout occurred during an MPU object stream, the
  gateway logged it as `"MPU decrypt failed mid-stream after 200 OK"` and
  emitted `mpu_tamper_detected_midstream` audit/metric events. The handler
  now distinguishes `*net.OpError` timeouts, `ECONNRESET`, and `EPIPE` from
  actual authentication failures, logging network aborts at Warn level with
  no tamper side-effects.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-04

### Security

- **HKDF-based chunk-IV derivation** (V1.0-SEC-2): new chunked objects now
  use HKDF-SHA256 instead of XOR for per-chunk IV derivation. Objects carry
  `x-amz-meta-enc-iv-deriv="hkdf-sha256"`; legacy objects without the flag
  continue to decrypt via the retained XOR read path (deprecated until v3.0).
  Operators can migrate legacy objects with `s3eg-migrate --migration-class sec2`.

- **Restrict AAD fallback to explicitly marked legacy objects** (V1.0-SEC-4):
  the blind `gcm.Open(..., nil)` fallback is now gated behind
  `x-amz-meta-enc-legacy-no-aad="true"`. New objects never receive this flag.
  Recovery path: `s3eg-migrate backfill-legacy-no-aad` followed by
  `s3eg-migrate --migration-class sec4`.

- **Streaming chunked metadata-fallback format v2** (V1.0-SEC-27): eliminates
  the redundant outer `aead.Seal` from `encryptChunkedWithMetadataFallback`.
  The fallback body is now a streaming
  `[4-byte BE metadata_length][metadata_json][chunked_stream]`. Peak allocation
  is now O(chunkSize + metadataSize) regardless of object size. A new
  `x-amz-meta-encryption-fallback-version: "2"` header identifies the format;
  legacy objects remain readable via the preserved v1 decoder.

- **UploadPartCopy buffer caps** (V1.0-SEC-29): capped two unbounded
  `io.ReadAll` calls in chunked-source `UploadPartCopy` handling at
  `maxCopyPartRangeBytes` (5 GiB). All `io.ReadAll` sites now have consistent
  bounding comments.

### Added

- **Offline migration tool** (`s3eg-migrate`) (V1.0-MAINT-1): new CLI for
  batch re-encryption and format migration. Supports scoped migration
  (`--migration-class all | sec2 | sec4 | sec27`), dry-run, post-write
  verification, resumable state file, and a `backfill-legacy-no-aad`
  sub-command. See `docs/MIGRATION.md`.
- `Makefile` targets `migrate`, `migrate-multiarch`, `build-multiarch`.
- `.github/workflows/helm.yml` now builds and attaches `s3eg-migrate` binaries
  (linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/arm64) to every Helm chart release.

### Changed

- Exported `IsEncryptionMetadata` and `IsCompressionMetadata` from
  `internal/crypto/engine.go` so the migration tool can reuse them.

### Fixed

- **Constant-time token comparison** in `internal/admin/auth.go`: replaced
  string equality with `hmac.Equal` for bearer-token validation.
- **Chunked-mode startup warning** in `cmd/server/main.go`: emits an explicit
  `WARN`-level log when `chunked_mode: true` is set, reminding operators that
  chunked encryption is opt-in and has provider-specific compatibility
  implications.

### Dependencies

- Updated `github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify` to v1.10.1

## [0.6.4] — 2026-04-29

### Security

This patch release addresses eighteen security findings from the v1.0 deep
security analysis (DAF-01 through DAF-18). All fixes are non-breaking; no
configuration changes are required unless noted.

- **SigV4 header auth: clock-skew / replay protection** (V1.0-SEC-11):
  `ValidateSignatureV4` now validates `X-Amz-Date` against server time for
  header-based SigV4 requests using a configurable clock-skew tolerance
  (`auth.sigv4_clock_skew`, default 5 minutes). A monotonic request counter
  (`X-Amz-Nonce`) is supported as an optional anti-replay mechanism.

- **Remove key padding in `deriveKey`** (V1.0-SEC-12):
  Removed the catastrophic fallback that repeated the key prefix to reach
  `keySize`. Keys shorter than 32 bytes now return an error immediately.
  Companion validation added in `decryptChunked` and `DecryptRange`
  (V1.0-SEC-15), so unexpectedly short KMS keys are rejected rather than
  padded.

- **Bounded goroutine spawning in audit BatchSink** (V1.0-SEC-13):
  `BatchSink.WriteEvent` now uses a semaphore (`maxConcurrentFlushes`)
  instead of spawning unbounded goroutines. Events dropped under backpressure
  are counted by `dropped_audit_events_total`.

- **Streaming chunked encryption** (V1.0-SEC-14):
  `encryptChunked` no longer calls `io.ReadAll` on the entire plaintext.
  Memory usage is now bounded by the chunk pipeline regardless of object size.

- **Trusted-proxy-aware tracing middleware** (V1.0-SEC-16):
  `TracingMiddleware` now uses the existing `TrustedProxies` configuration
  when extracting client IPs for `http.client_ip` span attributes. It no
  longer blindly trusts `X-Real-IP` or the leftmost `X-Forwarded-For` entry.

- **Redact presigned signatures from OTel spans** (V1.0-SEC-17):
  `HTTPURL` span attributes now contain `scheme://host/path` only. The query
  string (including `X-Amz-Signature`) is excluded; a separate redaction-safe
  `http.query` attribute is available when `redactSensitive=false`.

- **Remove debug Printf from S3 client** (V1.0-SEC-18):
  All `debug.Enabled()` blocks in `internal/s3/client.go` now use
  `slog.Debug(..., "len", len(v))` instead of `fmt.Printf` with 30-character
  value previews. No raw metadata (salt, IV, wrapped key) is ever logged.

- **Remove double-buffering in metadata fallback encrypt** (V1.0-SEC-27):
  `encryptWithMetadataFallback` no longer holds both plaintext and ciphertext
  in memory simultaneously. Peak heap is now `objectSize + overhead` instead
  of `2× objectSize` for large objects.

- **Password loaded as `[]byte` from the start** (V1.0-SEC-19):
  `cmd/server/main.go` now loads the encryption password directly into a
  `[]byte` slice and zeroizes it immediately after passing it to the engine
  constructor. Go's immutable `string` intermediate is eliminated; the
  explicit security guidance in `docs/SECURITY.md` is updated accordingly.

- **TTL-based engine cache with `Close()` on eviction** (V1.0-SEC-20):
  `engineCache` is now a TTL cache with a background sweep goroutine. Engines
  are `Close()`d and their passwords zeroized on eviction and on server
  shutdown, preventing unbounded accumulation of active password buffers.

- **Admin `MaxHeaderBytes`** (V1.0-SEC-21):
  The admin HTTP server now explicitly sets `MaxHeaderBytes` (64 KB default),
  preventing memory exhaustion via oversized headers.

- **Cached admin token with refresh loop** (V1.0-SEC-22):
  The admin bearer token is now read once at startup and cached in a
  `RWMutex`-protected field. A `tokenRefreshLoop` re-reads the file every 30
  seconds and validates permissions, eliminating per-request disk I/O without
  losing the ability to rotate tokens at runtime.

- **Hardened TLS cipher suites** (V1.0-SEC-23):
  Both admin listener and Cosmian KMS TLS configs now explicitly restrict
  `CipherSuites` (ECDHE+AES-256-GCM / CHACHA20-POLY1305) and
  `CurvePreferences` (X25519, P-256). CBC-mode ciphers are rejected.

- **Recovery middleware is outermost** (V1.0-SEC-24):
  Middleware ordering corrected so `RecoveryMiddleware` wraps all other
  middleware (logging, security headers, tracing, bucket validation, rate
  limiting). Panics in any layer now gracefully return HTTP 500 instead of
  crashing the server goroutine.

- **Multipart upload respects configured algorithm** (V1.0-SEC-25):
  `initMPUEncryptionState` now calls `engine.PreferredAlgorithm()` instead of
  hardcoding `"AES256GCM"`. `NewMPUPartEncryptReader` and `NewMPUDecryptReader`
  accept an `algorithm string` parameter. This means policies configured for
  `ChaCha20-Poly1305` are honored for multipart uploads.

- **Audit FileSink permissions** (V1.0-SEC-26):
  Audit log files are now created with `0600` permissions instead of `0644`.

- **Admin token file TOCTOU fix** (V1.0-SEC-28):
  Token file validation now uses `os.Lstat` instead of `os.Stat` to detect
  symlinks and prevent TOCTOU races between permission check and read.

### Dependencies

- Updated `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2` to v1.41.7
- Updated `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/credentials` to v1.19.16
- Updated `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3` to v1.100.1

## [0.6.3] — 2026-04-28

### Security

This patch release addresses eight security findings from the v0.6 security
analysis. All fixes are non-breaking; no configuration changes are required
unless noted.

- **Sensitive data zeroization, constant-time audit & crypto hygiene**
  (V1.0-SEC-1): Six concrete crypto-hardening findings in `internal/crypto/`:
  - `engine.password` changed from `string` to `[]byte`; new `Close()` method
    zeroizes the password buffer before deallocation.
  - `mpuDecryptReader.returnEncBuf()` now zeroizes `r.dek` after use; the
    reader defensively copies the caller's DEK so the caller can safely
    `zeroBytes(dek)` immediately after construction.
  - Removed base64-encoded wrapped-key material from error messages; only
    non-secret length information is retained.
  - `computeETag` split into build-tagged files (`etag_default.go` with
    `crypto/md5`, `etag_fips.go` with SHA-256) so FIPS builds never link
    MD5. ETag remains an S3 protocol identifier with no cryptographic
    security requirement.
  - KMIP adapter ECB comment corrected: `keymanager_cosmian.go` now
    documents that AES-KW (RFC 3394) or AES-GCM is used internally and
    that ECB is **not** suitable for key wrapping.
  - Constant-time comparison audit confirmed: all credential/token
    comparisons use `hmac.Equal` or `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare`.

- **Remove debug logging of cryptographic parameters** (V1.0-SEC-3):
  All `fmt.Printf` calls inside `debug.Enabled()` blocks in
  `internal/crypto/engine.go` have been replaced with `slog.Debug(...)`.
  Raw cryptographic values (salt bytes, IV bytes, ciphertext previews) are
  never logged; only lengths are recorded. A startup warning is emitted at
  `WARN` level when debug mode is active.

- **Integer overflow in encrypted range calculation** (V1.0-SEC-5):
  `calculateEncryptedByteRange` in `internal/crypto/range_optimization.go`
  now validates inputs before `int64` promotion and returns an `error` on
  overflow, preventing incorrect byte-range offsets on 32-bit platforms or
  adversarially crafted metadata.

- **X-Forwarded-For header spoofing** (V1.0-SEC-6):
  `getClientIP` and `getClientKey` no longer blindly trust the leftmost IP in
  `X-Forwarded-For`. A new `TrustedProxies []string` configuration field
  (`server.trusted_proxies`) accepts CIDRs; when the immediate remote peer is
  a trusted proxy, the gateway walks the XFF chain right-to-left to find the
  first non-trusted IP. Default is empty (fail-safe: `RemoteAddr` always used).
  See `docs/POLICY_CONFIGURATION.md` for configuration examples.

- **Replaced `math/rand` with `crypto/rand` in retry jitter** (V1.0-SEC-7):
  All four backend retry jitter strategies (`full`, `decorrelated`, `equal`,
  `none`) in `internal/s3/retry.go` now use `crypto/rand.Reader` via the new
  `cryptoRandInt63n` helper. This removes the only `math/rand` usage in the
  codebase and eliminates the suppressed `gosec` G404 finding. Behaviour is
  unchanged; jitter values remain in the expected statistical bounds.

- **Hardened HTTP transport for audit sink** (V1.0-SEC-8):
  `internal/audit/sink.go` now constructs `*http.Client` with a fully
  configured `http.Transport` (TLS handshake timeout, response header timeout,
  idle/max connection limits, per-host concurrency cap). All limits are
  exposed as `HTTPTransportConfig` fields under `audit.http.*` in
  `config.yaml` for operator tuning. Slow or unresponsive audit endpoints
  no longer risk connection exhaustion. A `dropped_audit_events_total`
  Prometheus counter tracks events lost under backpressure.

- **Startup warning for `InsecureSkipVerify`** (V1.0-SEC-9):
  When `InsecureSkipVerify` is enabled for Cosmian KMS or Valkey TLS
  connections, an `ERROR`-level log is emitted at startup with the exact
  environment variable name and a clear MITM warning, ensuring operators
  cannot accidentally run with disabled certificate verification in
  production without an alert-pipeline-visible indication.

- **Rate limiter timing side-channel mitigation** (V1.0-SEC-10):
  `RateLimiter.Allow` in `internal/middleware/security.go` now enforces a
  constant minimum execution time (`minAllowTime = 50µs`) via a deferred
  spin-wait, preventing timing measurements from revealing token-bucket state.
  Benchmark confirms P99 latency stays within `minAllowTime + 20µs`.

### Dependencies

- Updated `github.com/redis/go-redis/v9` to v9.19.0
- Updated `github.com/ovh/kmip-go` to v0.8.1
- Updated `peter-evans/create-or-update-comment` to v5

---

## [0.6.2] — 2026-04-27

### Changed

- **First-class inline bucket policies** (`helm/`): The Helm chart now accepts
  bucket policy definitions directly in `values.yaml` via a top-level
  `policies` list, eliminating the need for manual `extraVolumes` /
  `extraVolumeMounts` to mount policy files. Each entry maps 1:1 to
  `PolicyConfig` (`internal/config/policy.go`) and supports all fields:
  `encrypt_multipart_uploads`, `require_encryption`, `disallow_lock_bypass`,
  and per-bucket `encryption` / `compression` / `rate_limit` overrides.

  The chart renders a `<release>-policies` ConfigMap from the list, mounts it
  at `/etc/s3-gateway/policies/`, and sets `POLICIES=/etc/s3-gateway/policies/*.yaml`
  automatically. The previous `config.policies.value` path-glob approach is
  preserved for operators who mount policy files from an external source; a new
  render-time guard (Guard 6) enforces that both paths cannot be set
  simultaneously. Schema validation (`values.schema.json`) enforces the
  required `id` and `buckets` fields at `helm install --dry-run` time.

  Example:

  ```yaml
  valkey:
    enabled: true

  policies:
    - id: encrypted-uploads
      buckets:
        - "my-important-bucket"
        - "logs-*"
      encrypt_multipart_uploads: true
      require_encryption: true
  ```

### Fixed

- **Gremlins v0.6 API compatibility** (`.github/workflows/mutation.yml`,
  `scripts/mutation-report.sh`): Gremlins v0.6 removed the `--only-covered`
  flag (now the default), renamed `--json-output` to `-o`, and changed the
  JSON output schema from a `.mutants[]` array to flat top-level fields
  (`mutants_total`, `mutants_killed`, etc.). The mutation workflow and report
  script were updated accordingly. Added `permissions.issues: write` so the
  regression-issue step can create and comment on issues via `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

### CI & Infrastructure

- **Helm README synced to `gh-pages`** (`.github/workflows/helm.yml`): The
  release workflow now copies `helm/s3-encryption-gateway/README.md` to the
  `gh-pages` branch automatically so the Artifact Hub listing stays current
  without a manual step.

- **chart-releaser skipped when version is unchanged**
  (`.github/workflows/helm.yml`): The release job now checks whether the chart
  version in `Chart.yaml` has already been published before invoking
  `chart-releaser`, preventing duplicate-release errors on documentation-only
  pushes to `main`.

- **Helm test suite stabilised** (`.github/workflows/helm-test.yml`,
  `helm/s3-encryption-gateway/scripts/test-progressive-delivery.sh`): Fixed
  two categories of failures — flaky assertions in the progressive-delivery
  script and a Helm 3 / Helm 4 API incompatibility in flag handling. Both
  Helm 3 and Helm 4 are now exercised in CI.

- **Removed stale `coverage-fips.out` artefact**: The accidentally-committed
  FIPS coverage profile (72 k lines) has been removed from the repository.

---

## [0.6.1] — 2026-04-25

### Testing & Quality

- **Coverage gate ≥ 75% and mutation testing** (V0.6-QA-2): The project now
  enforces a hard ≥ 75% statement coverage gate on every PR and push to `main`
  via `scripts/coverage-gate.sh`, wired into the `coverage-gate` CI job in
  `.github/workflows/conformance.yml`. The FIPS build profile (`-tags=fips`)
  is gated separately. Nightly mutation testing via
  [Gremlins](https://github.com/go-gremlins/gremlins) runs on `internal/config`,
  `internal/api`, `internal/s3`, and `internal/middleware` with a ≥ 70%
  kill-rate target; `internal/crypto` is covered by fuzz tests instead.
  See [`docs/COVERAGE.md`](docs/COVERAGE.md) for the exclusion policy and
  regeneration guide.

- **Per-provider performance baselines** (V0.6-QA-1): established a
  reproducible measurement methodology and committed baseline corpus
  under `docs/perf/v0.6-qa-1/` (micro-benchmarks for 19 tracked Go
  functions + macro JSON per local provider — MinIO, Garage, RustFS,
  SeaweedFS). A nightly `performance-baseline` GitHub workflow re-runs
  both the micro and per-provider soak suites and fails on > 15 %
  throughput drops, > 20 % p95 growth, > 25 % p99 growth, any new
  `allocs/op`, or any new error where the baseline was zero (thresholds
  per plan §6.1). Pull requests receive a sticky advisory benchstat
  comment (never fails the PR — CI runners are too noisy for per-PR
  gating). Two new benchmarks — `BenchmarkMPUDecryptReader_100MiB` and
  the three `BenchmarkUploadPartCopy_*` variants — close the benchmark
  gaps flagged by PERF-1 and S3-1. See
  [`docs/PERFORMANCE.md`](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) and
  [`docs/plans/V0.6-QA-1-plan.md`](docs/plans/V0.6-QA-1-plan.md).

### Operations & Helm

- **Helm values JSON Schema** (V0.6-OPS-2): the chart now ships
  `values.schema.json` (JSON Schema draft-07), validated by `helm lint`,
  `helm install`, and `helm upgrade` before the chart renders.

  - **~140 leaf keys covered** with type constraints, enums, patterns, and
    descriptions. Typos like `config.encriptoin.*` are now caught at lint
    time, not at pod startup.
  - **Schema-encoded invariants** (I1–I3, I5, I7): `track + valkey.enabled`
    conflict, dual-ingress conflict, weighted-without-Traefik conflict,
    KeyManager provider validation, and TLS cert requirement.
  - **New `values.prod.yaml` overlay**: hardened production defaults —
    3-replica HA floor, HPA (3–20 replicas), PDB (minAvailable: 2),
    NetworkPolicy, Prometheus ServiceMonitor, TLS via cert-manager, audit
    logging, rate limiting, preStop hook, and zone-level topology spread.
  - **New `values.dev.yaml` overlay**: minimal local-development defaults —
    1 replica, debug log level, audit logging, in-cluster Valkey subchart.
  - **15 negative schema tests** (`tests/schema/bad-*.yaml`) and 6 positive
    tests (`tests/schema/good-*.yaml`), with `run-negative.sh` harness.
  - **CI extended** with 5 new jobs: `lint-base`, `lint-overlays`,
    `schema-negative`, `schema-drift`, `render-overlays`.
  - **Chart version bumped 0.5.10 → 0.6.0** (additive, non-breaking for
    valid values; schema rejects values that always silently produced broken
    deployments).

  See `docs/plans/V0.6-OPS-2-plan.md` and the "Values Validation" section in
  `helm/s3-encryption-gateway/README.md`.

- **Blue/green and canary deployment recipes** (V0.6-OPS-1): the Helm chart
  now ships production-safe progressive-delivery topologies for zero-downtime
  upgrades of the S3 Encryption Gateway.

  - **New chart value `track`** (default `""`): labels pods for selector-based
    traffic routing. Set to `"blue"`, `"green"`, `"stable"`, or `"canary"`.
    Single-release deployments see no change (backward compatible; empty track
    emits no label).

  - **New `ingress.traefik.*` values**: first-class Traefik v3 CRD support.
    - `ingress.traefik.enabled: true` renders a `traefik.io/v1alpha1`
      `IngressRoute` as the replacement for the standard `networking.k8s.io/v1`
      Ingress. Mutually exclusive with `ingress.enabled` (chart enforces this).
    - `ingress.traefik.weighted.enabled: true` renders a `kind: Weighted`
      `TraefikService` + companion `IngressRoute` for the canary traffic-split
      topology. Weights must sum to 100 (chart enforces this).

  - **New `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` and `lifecycle` values**: expose
    pod lifecycle knobs for safe connection draining during traffic flips.
    Default `terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30` preserves existing behaviour.

  - **Template-time guard-rails** (`templates/validate.yaml`):
    - `track` + `valkey.enabled: true` → render-time error (shared Valkey
      required for MPU state continuity across traffic flips).
    - `track` without a Valkey address → render-time error.
    - `ingress.enabled` + `ingress.traefik.enabled` both true → render-time error.
    - `ingress.traefik.weighted.enabled` without `ingress.traefik.enabled` → error.
    - Weighted services not summing to 100 → render-time error.

  - **New chart templates**: `templates/ingressroute.yaml`,
    `templates/traefikservice.yaml` (both opt-in; emit zero output by default).

  - **Per-track Prometheus relabeling**: `ServiceMonitor` and `PodMonitor`
    templates now emit a `track` relabel rule when `track` is set, enabling
    per-track PromQL queries and Grafana dashboard filtering.

  - **Example values files** (`helm/s3-encryption-gateway/examples/`):
    `values-blue.yaml`, `values-green.yaml`, `values-canary-stable.yaml`,
    `values-canary-canary.yaml`, `values-traefik-single.yaml`.

  - **Raw manifest examples** (`docs/examples/`):
    - `bluegreen/service.yaml` — operator-owned shared Service for the
      selector-flip pattern.
    - `bluegreen/external-valkey.yaml` — minimal shared Valkey StatefulSet.
    - `bluegreen/cutover.sh` — cutover and rollback script.
    - `canary/traefikservice.yaml`, `canary/ingressroute.yaml` — operator-owned
      Traefik resources for the weighted canary split.
    - `canary/promote.sh` — progressive weight promotion (5 → 25 → 50 → 100).
    - `canary/rollback.sh` — emergency rollback script.
    - `gateway-api/httproute.yaml` — portable Gateway API `HTTPRoute` equivalent
      (documentation appendix; not a chart template in v0.6).

  - **Operator runbook**: `docs/OPS_DEPLOYMENT.md` is the single authoritative
    source for blue/green and canary procedures, including the stateful
    invariants (shared Valkey, key-version parity, draining semantics),
    per-track observability, troubleshooting guide, Gateway API appendix,
    and Argo Rollouts / Flagger optional overlay recipe.

  - **CI**: `.github/workflows/helm-test.yml` extended with progressive-delivery
    render checks and guard-rail smoke tests.

  - See `docs/plans/V0.6-OPS-1-plan.md` for full design rationale.

### Observability

- **Admin pprof profiling endpoints** (V0.6-OBS-1): production-safe runtime
  profiling is now available at `/admin/debug/pprof/*` on the **admin
  listener** when `admin.profiling.enabled: true`.

  - **Disabled by default.** Enabling requires `admin.enabled: true`;
    on non-loopback addresses also requires `admin.tls.enabled: true`.

  - **Security-inheriting.** All 11 pprof endpoints (index, cmdline,
    profile, symbol, trace, heap, goroutine, allocs, block, mutex,
    threadcreate) reuse the existing admin bearer-token auth, rate
    limiter, and TLS — no new auth surface.

  - **Semaphore-bounded.** `/profile` and `/trace` are bounded by
    `max_concurrent_profiles` (default 2) and `max_profile_seconds`
    (default 60); excess requests return `429 Retry-After: 1`.

  - **Block/mutex profiling knobs.** `block_rate` and `mutex_fraction`
    (both default 0/off) are passed to
    `runtime.SetBlockProfileRate` / `SetMutexProfileFraction` at startup.

  - **Audited.** Every fetch emits a `pprof_fetch` audit event with
    endpoint, duration, and HTTP status.

  - **New Prometheus metrics:** `s3_gateway_admin_pprof_requests_total
    {endpoint, outcome}` (bounded cardinality: 11 × 4 = 44 label
    combinations) and `gateway_admin_profiling_enabled` gauge.

  - **Dockerfile `STRIP_SYMBOLS` build-arg.** Both `Dockerfile` and
    `Dockerfile.fips` now accept `--build-arg STRIP_SYMBOLS=false` to
    produce a symbolicated binary for profiling sessions without
    permanently removing symbols from production images. Use
    `make profile-image` as a convenience shortcut.

  - **Operator recipes** added to `docs/OBSERVABILITY.md §"Runtime
    Profiling"` (CPU flamegraph, heap snapshot, goroutine-leak workflow).

  - **Admin API reference** updated in `docs/ADMIN_API.md` with the
    route table and response code semantics.

  - **New config keys** (all optional, default `false`/`0`):
    `admin.profiling.enabled`, `.block_rate`, `.mutex_fraction`,
    `.max_concurrent_profiles` (default 2), `.max_profile_seconds`
    (default 60). See `config.yaml.example` for the annotated stanza.

  - **ADR 0011** filed: `docs/adr/0011-admin-profiling-endpoints.md`.

  - See `docs/plans/V0.6-OBS-1-plan.md` for full design rationale.

### Performance

- **Configurable S3 backend retry policy** (V0.6-PERF-2):
  Replaced the SDK-default retryer with a gateway-specific `aws.RetryerV2`
  implementation (`internal/s3/retry.go`) backed by the new
  `backend.retry.*` configuration stanza:

  - **Operator-configurable knobs** (all optional, defaults match SDK
    behaviour): `mode` (`standard` | `adaptive` | `off`),
    `max_attempts` (1–10, default 3), `initial_backoff` (default 100 ms),
    `max_backoff` (default 20 s), `jitter`
    (`full` | `decorrelated` | `equal` | `none`, default `full`),
    `per_operation` override map, `safe_copy_object` gate.

  - **Idempotency safeguards**: `CompleteMultipartUpload` now defaults to
    `max_attempts: 1` (non-idempotent post-commit); retrying a successful
    Complete would return `NoSuchUpload` and confuse the caller. Callers
    that need retry should do so at the application layer.

  - **HTTP 429 classified as retryable** for all backends (the SDK's
    default classifier only retries 429 if the response body contains a
    known throttle error code, which Wasabi and Hetzner do not include).

  - **Crypto errors are hard non-retryable** (`ErrInvalidEnvelope`,
    `ErrUnwrapFailed`, `ErrKeyNotFound`, `ErrProviderUnavailable`) — no
    auto-retry on tamper-detected objects.

  - **Context-aware sleep** — request cancellation interrupts a sleeping
    retry without goroutine leaks.

  - **`Retry-After` header honoured** for HTTP 429/503 responses.

  - **Three new Prometheus metrics**:
    `s3_backend_retries_total{operation, reason, mode}`,
    `s3_backend_attempts_per_request{operation}`,
    `s3_backend_retry_give_ups_total{operation, final_reason}`, and
    `s3_backend_retry_backoff_seconds` histogram.

  - **Audit event** `backend.retry_give_up` emitted on data-plane write
    give-ups (not on read-path give-ups to avoid noise).

  - **`adaptive` mode** available for contended backends; wraps the SDK's
    `retry.AdaptiveMode` token bucket.

  - **`off` mode** disables retries entirely for debug and
    conformance-test isolation.

  - See `docs/adr/0010-backend-retry-policy.md` and
    `config.yaml.example` for the full knob reference.

- **Zero-copy streaming on hot data paths** (V0.6-PERF-1): eliminated
  full-object in-memory buffers on the most allocation-heavy paths:

  - **`handleGetObject` optimised range path**: the `io.ReadAll` at the
    partial-content response stage is replaced with `io.CopyBuffer`
    directly to the response writer using a pooled 64 KiB buffer.
    `Content-Length` is computed from the already-known plaintext range,
    so no intermediate `[]byte` slice is needed.

  - **`handleCopyObject`**: the double-allocation
    (`ReadAll(decryptedReader)` → `Encrypt(bytes.NewReader(decryptedData))`
    → `ReadAll(encryptedReader)`) is reduced to a single allocation
    inside the engine. `decryptedReader` is now passed directly to
    `Encrypt`, eliminating the intermediate `decryptedData []byte`. A
    legacy-source size cap (`Server.MaxLegacyCopySourceBytes`, default
    256 MiB) is now also enforced on `handleCopyObject` (previously
    only on `UploadPartCopy`).

  - **`handleUploadPart`**: `io.ReadAll(r.Body)` and
    `io.ReadAll(encReader)` are replaced with a pooled
    `SeekableBody` wrapper (`internal/s3/seekable_body.go`) that
    satisfies the AWS SDK V2 SigV4 seekable-body contract while capping
    heap per part at `Server.MaxPartBuffer` (new config knob, default
    **64 MiB**). Parts above the cap are refused with HTTP 413 before
    any backend write occurs.

  - **Compression engine** (`internal/crypto/compression.go`):
    `Compress` now returns a streaming `io.Pipe` reader instead of
    buffering the full compressed output; `Decompress` returns a
    `*gzip.Reader` wrapping the plaintext directly. The post-hoc
    "skip if compressed ≥ original" size check is removed in favour of
    the `ShouldCompress` pre-filter (size + content-type), consistent
    with nginx / Envoy precedent. ADR 0006 addendum documents the
    behaviour change.

  - **Engine compression branch** (`internal/crypto/engine.go`): the
    `bytes.NewReader(compressedData)` intermediate re-wrap is eliminated;
    the compression pipe reader flows directly into the AEAD boundary.
    The engine Decrypt path also drops a redundant `io.ReadAll →
    bytes.NewReader` round-trip.

  - **Streaming MPU part encrypt reader**
    (`internal/crypto/mpu_encrypter.go`, Phase G): `NewMPUPartEncryptReader`
    now returns a true streaming `io.Reader` (`*mpuEncryptReader`) that
    encrypts one 64 KiB AEAD chunk per `Read` call. Peak heap per part
    is O(chunkSize + tagSize) ≈ 65 KiB regardless of part size, down
    from O(plaintext + ciphertext). The DEK is defensively copied by
    the reader so that callers may safely zero their DEK slice
    immediately after the constructor returns (fixing a latent bug
    where `defer zeroBytes(dek)` would corrupt IVs under the previous
    streaming design). IV derivation remains deterministic — retries
    produce byte-identical ciphertext.

### Added

- **Unified multi-provider conformance test suite** (V0.6-QA-4):
  Introduced `test/provider/`, `test/harness/`, and
  `test/conformance/` packages implementing a three-tier test taxonomy
  (Unit / Conformance / Soak+Load+Chaos). The new `Provider` interface
  and Testcontainers-Go-backed MinIO (`minio/minio:RELEASE.2024-11-07T00-52-20Z`),
  Garage (`dxflrs/garage:v2.3.0`), and Valkey (`valkey/valkey:8.0-alpine`)
  implementations replace the four inconsistent test harness variants
  that existed previously. 32 provider-agnostic conformance tests
  cover PutGet, Head, List, Delete, BatchDelete, CopyObject, ranged
  reads (including cross-chunk boundaries), chunked and legacy AEAD
  encryption, multipart upload (basic / abort / list-parts),
  UploadPartCopy (full / range / plaintext / legacy / mixed / abort /
  cross-bucket), object tagging, presigned URLs, key-rotation
  dual-read window, Object Lock retention / legal-hold / bypass-refused,
  metadata round-trip, and concurrent operations under `-race`.
  External S3 vendors (AWS, Wasabi, Backblaze B2, Hetzner) plug in
  via a one-file pattern and activate automatically when credentials
  are set. A mechanical `matrix_guard_test.go` AST check prevents
  provider-name literals from appearing in conformance test bodies;
  `scripts/test-isolation.sh` prevents regression to `docker-compose`
  / hard-coded ports / binary backend invocations.

  New `make` targets: `test-conformance`, `test-conformance-local`,
  `test-conformance-minio`, `test-conformance-external`,
  `test-isolation-check`. `make test-comprehensive` now runs
  tier-1 + local conformance + isolation check without requiring
  `docker-compose up`. See `docs/TESTING.md`.

  **Phase-1 hotfix**: `StartSharedMinIOServerForProvider` in
  `test/minio.go` now creates the bucket before returning, fixing the
  root cause of the `TestProvider_Compatibility` /
  `TestGateway_ProviderIntegration` failures in `make test-comprehensive`
  step 3.

### Fixed

- **User metadata was silently dropped on PUT / CopyObject / MPU**
  (uncovered by V0.6-QA-4). Four sites in `internal/api/handlers.go`
  (`handlePutObject`, `filterS3Metadata`, `handleCreateMultipartUpload`,
  `handleCopyObject`) compared `k[:11] == "x-amz-meta-"` against keys
  from `r.Header`. Go canonicalises HTTP headers to `X-Amz-Meta-Foo`
  on parse, so the case-sensitive comparison never matched and all
  `x-amz-meta-*` headers were discarded. Replaced with
  `strings.HasPrefix(strings.ToLower(k), "x-amz-meta-")` and
  lowercase the map key for downstream consistency.

- **`DeleteObjects` failed against MinIO and older S3-compatible
  backends** (uncovered by V0.6-QA-4). MinIO
  (pre-`RELEASE.2024-11-07T00-52-20Z` era) and many other backends
  only validate the legacy `Content-MD5` integrity header; AWS SDK
  v2 migrated to `x-amz-checksum-*` and no longer auto-computes
  `Content-MD5`. Added a smithy finalize-stage middleware in
  `internal/s3/client.go` that computes and sets `Content-MD5`
  from the serialised body when not already present. Idempotent
  against AWS (which also accepts the header).

### Added

- **Object Lock / Retention / Legal Hold pass-through** (V0.6-S3-2):
  the six Object-Lock subresource endpoints are now routed
  (`PUT/GET /{bucket}/{key}?retention`, `?legal-hold`, and
  `PUT/GET /{bucket}?object-lock`) with strict XML validation, and
  the three `x-amz-object-lock-*` request headers are now forwarded
  end-to-end on `PutObject`, `CopyObject`, and
  `CompleteMultipartUpload`. `GetObject` / `HeadObject` responses
  surface the backend's `x-amz-object-lock-mode`,
  `x-amz-object-lock-retain-until-date`, and
  `x-amz-object-lock-legal-hold` headers. New ADR 0008 documents
  ciphertext-locking semantics and the interaction with key rotation.

### Changed

- **`x-amz-bypass-governance-retention` is now refused rather than
  silently dropped** (V0.6-S3-2). Any request carrying a truthy value
  for this header on `PutObjectRetention`, `DeleteObject`, or
  `DeleteObjects` now returns `403 AccessDenied` with an audit event
  (`reason=admin_authorization_not_implemented`). The previous
  behaviour (silent drop plus no retention effect) produced a false
  sense of compliance. Admin-gated forwarding lands with V0.6-CFG-1.

- **`Client` interface signatures** for `PutObject`, `CopyObject`,
  and `CompleteMultipartUpload` now take an optional
  `*ObjectLockInput`. Passing `nil` preserves the pre-change
  behaviour.

### Added

- **Admin API for Key Rotation** (V0.6-CFG-1): Separate admin listener with
  bearer-token authentication providing a safe drain-and-cutover key rotation
  workflow. Endpoints: `start`, `status`, `commit`, `abort`. Includes
  `RotatableKeyManager` extension interface for adapters that support runtime
  rotation, a `RotationState` state machine with atomic in-flight wrap
  tracking, and Prometheus metrics (`kms_active_key_version`,
  `kms_rotation_operations_total`, `kms_rotation_duration_seconds`,
  `kms_rotation_in_flight_wraps`, `gateway_admin_api_enabled`).
  Documentation: `docs/ADMIN_API.md`, ADR 0007.

- **Pluggable KeyManager Interface** (V0.6-SEC-1): Refactored to a pluggable
  `KeyManager` interface with adapters for in-memory, Cosmian KMIP, and HSM
  (build-tagged). Conformance test suite shared across all adapters.

- **FIPS-Compliant Crypto Profile** (V0.6-SEC-2): Optional FIPS build profile
  via `-tags=fips`; ChaCha20-Poly1305 excluded, AES-256-GCM only. PBKDF2
  migrated to stdlib. `Dockerfile.fips` and Helm FIPS overlay provided.

- **Multipart Copy Support** (V0.6-S3-1): `UploadPartCopy` handler with
  three source-class strategies (chunked, legacy, plaintext). 5 GiB per-call
  cap, legacy source OOM-defense cap, cross-bucket copy support.

- **Encrypted Multipart Uploads** (V0.6-SEC-3, ADR 0009): Closes the
  plaintext-at-rest gap for multipart uploads. Opt-in per bucket via
  `encrypt_multipart_uploads: true` in policy files. Architecture:
  - Per-upload 32-byte DEK wrapped by the configured `KeyManager`.
  - Per-part, per-chunk AEAD IVs derived via
    `HKDF-Expand(SHA-256, dek, salt=sha256(uploadId), info=ivPrefix||BE32(part)||BE32(chunk))`.
  - Finalization manifest stored as a companion object (`<key>.mpu-manifest`),
    with a metadata pointer on the final object.
  - `UploadPartCopy` into encrypted MPU destinations re-encrypts through
    the destination DEK schedule regardless of source class.
  - Range GETs supported: part-boundary arithmetic translates plaintext
    offsets to backend ciphertext offsets.
  - Tamper detection: AES-GCM tag failure on any chunk returns 500 + audit event.
  - **Requires Valkey** for in-flight state storage (`multipart_state.valkey.addr`).
    Startup fail-closed when Valkey is unreachable and any bucket policy enables
    encrypted MPU. Emergency escape hatch: `server.disable_multipart_uploads: true`.
  - New Prometheus metrics: `gateway_mpu_encrypted_total`,
    `gateway_mpu_parts_total`, `gateway_mpu_state_store_ops_total`,
    `gateway_mpu_state_store_latency_seconds`, `gateway_mpu_valkey_up`,
    `gateway_mpu_valkey_insecure`, `gateway_mpu_manifest_bytes`,
    `gateway_mpu_manifest_storage_total`.
  - New admin endpoints (gated by existing admin bearer auth):
    `POST /admin/mpu/abort/{uploadId}`, `GET /admin/mpu/list`.
  - New audit events: `mpu.create`, `mpu.part`, `mpu.complete`,
    `mpu.abort`, `mpu.tamper_detected`, `mpu.valkey_unavailable`.
  - `/readyz` endpoint extended with per-dependency checks (kms,
    valkey) returning a 503 with a JSON `checks` map when any
    configured dependency is unhealthy. K8s-convention aliases
    `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/livez` added.
  - Helm chart: optional `valkey` subchart dependency
    (https://valkey.io/valkey-helm/, Apache-2.0, verified
    publisher); `VALKEY_ADDR` auto-wired when
    `valkey.enabled=true`. All Valkey config keys also accept env
    var overrides (`VALKEY_ADDR`, `VALKEY_TLS_ENABLED`, etc.).
  - FIPS-compliant: AES-256-GCM + HKDF-SHA256 primitives only; no
    ChaCha20 dependency. All SEC-3 code passes `go test -tags=fips
    -race` cleanly.
  - Default: `false` in v0.6 for soak. v0.7 flips default to `true`.

- **UploadPartCopy + Encrypted MPU Integration Test Suite** (V0.6-S3-3,
  plan: `docs/plans/V0.6-S3-3-plan.md`): 18 new integration tests closing
  every gap flagged during V0.6-S3-1 and V0.6-SEC-3 delivery:
  - Tests 1–10 (`TestUploadPartCopy_{Chunked,Chunked_WithRange,Legacy,Plaintext,
    LargeSource_MustUseRange,CrossBucket,AbortMidway,MixedWithUploadPart,
    CrossBucket_ReadDenied_Integration,PlaintextSource_EncryptedDestBucket_Refused_Integration}`)
    run against a real MinIO backend.
  - Tests 11–13 (`TestUploadPartCopy_MPU_{PlaintextSource_EncryptedDest,
    ChunkedSource_EncryptedDest_WithRange,LegacySource_EncryptedDest}`)
    close the Phase-E zero-coverage gap: UploadPartCopy into encrypted-MPU
    destinations is now exercised end-to-end against MinIO + Valkey.
  - Tests 14–17 (`TestEncryptedMPU_PasswordKeyManager_{SmallObject,Ranged_GET,
    AtRestCiphertext,AbortDeletesState}`) replace the env-gated
    `test/encrypted_mpu_test.go` smoke test with proper CI-runnable assertions
    including at-rest ciphertext checks and Valkey state-deletion verification.
  - Test 18 (`TestCosmianKMS_EncryptedMPU_RoundTrip`) adds Cosmian-wrapped
    DEK coverage to the encrypted-MPU code path.
  - Test harness extensions: `StartGateway` now accepts variadic
    `TestGatewayOption` values (`WithPolicyManager`, `WithKeyManager`,
    `WithMPUStateStore`, `WithAuditLogger`, `WithHeadObjectOverride`);
    all 16 existing gateway tests compile and pass unchanged.
  - New `test/mpu_fixtures.go` with `NewTestMPUStateStore`,
    `NewTestPasswordKeyManager`, `NewRawBackendS3Client`,
    `NewTestPolicyManager`, `EncryptedMPUPolicy`, `TestBucketPrefix`.
  - `MinIOTestServer.SeedMinIOUser` helper for multi-credential tests
    (skips cleanly if `mc` CLI is absent).

### Fixed

- **`UploadPartCopy` Phase-E silent data loss** (`internal/api/upload_part_copy.go`):
  when `mpuStateStore.AppendPart` fails during an UploadPartCopy into an
  encrypted-MPU destination, the handler previously logged a warning and
  returned 200 OK, leaving the encryption state store inconsistent. The fix
  aligns this path with `handlers.go:2730-2757`: the handler now logs at
  error level, records `RecordS3Error("AppendMPUPartState", "StateUnavailable")`,
  emits a `mpu.valkey_unavailable` audit event, and returns **503
  ServiceUnavailable** so the client retries. A duplicate backend part from
  a retry is discarded by `CompleteMultipartUpload`'s ETag-set reconciliation.
  New unit test: `TestUploadPartCopy_MPU_AppendPartFailure_Returns503`.

### CI & Dependencies

- **Disabled Dependabot Go module updates**: Renovate now handles all Go
  dependency updates; Dependabot configuration removed for Go modules to
  prevent duplicate PRs.

- **Fixed Helm chart release CI pipeline**: resolved failures in the Helm
  release GitHub Actions workflow caused by incompatible action versions.

- **Fixed FIPS coverage gate**: corrected the FIPS-tagged build coverage test
  that was failing due to a test setup issue in the mutation workflow.

- **Fixed mutation testing workflow**: repaired the nightly Gremlins mutation
  CI job that had broken after the coverage gate refactor.

- Updated `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/s3` to v1.100.0
- Updated `github.com/aws/smithy-go` to v1.25.1

  (`V0.6-DOC-1`): `docs/` updated throughout to reflect the pluggable
  `KeyManager` interface as the canonical configuration path; the legacy
  single-password stanza is documented as a compatibility alias only.

- Finalised v0.6 issue tracker (`docs/issues/v0.6-issues.md`): all
  planned items marked complete.

---

## [0.5.10] — 2026-04-17

### Security

- **Hardened authentication error handling to prevent information leakage**:
  introduced sentinel error types (`ErrSignatureMismatch`, `ErrUnknownAccessKey`,
  `ErrMissingCredentials`, `ErrSigV4NotSupportedWithPassthrough`) for reliable
  error classification without relying on string matching. Errors are now
  classified via `errors.Is()` rather than brittle message parsing, eliminating
  the risk of leaking computed HMAC signatures into response bodies. Signature
  validation now uses constant-time comparison (`hmac.Equal`) to prevent timing
  side channels. All error diagnostics are logged server-side while opaque
  responses are returned to clients.

- **Fixed possible credential exposure in logs**: sanitised log output paths
  where credential material could appear in structured log fields.

### Added

- **Range request optimisation for chunked encryption**: implemented efficient

  boundaries, avoiding full object decryption for partial reads.

- **Metadata compaction policy** (V0.4-SEC-2): implemented a metadata fallback
  storage strategy for backends with strict object metadata size limits (e.g.
  AWS S3's 2 KB limit). Encryption metadata that exceeds the limit is stored
  as a sidecar object, with a pointer in the object's user metadata.

- **Multipart upload stability and interop** (V0.4-S3-2): improved multipart
  upload compatibility across S3-compatible backends. Note: multipart uploads
  in v0.4 are stored without client-side encryption (encryption gap closed in
  v0.6-SEC-3); `server.disable_multipart_uploads: true` can be set to prevent
  unencrypted multipart objects at the cost of large-file support.

- **List operations parity** (V0.4-S3-1): implemented full `ListObjectsV2`
  and `ListObjects` (v1) parity including `delimiter`, `prefix`, `continuation-token`,
  `max-keys`, and `fetch-owner` parameters.

- **Hot-reload of non-crypto configuration** (V0.4-CFG-1): the gateway now
  watches the config file for changes and reloads non-cryptographic settings
  (log level, rate limits, access log format, etc.) without restart using
  `fsnotify`.

- **OpenTelemetry distributed tracing** (V0.4-OBS-1): added OTLP trace export
  for all gateway request handlers with span attributes covering request method,
  bucket, key, response status, and encryption operation type.

- **Access log presets** (V0.4-OBS-2): structured access logging with
  configurable JSON and Common Log Format (CLF) presets. Sensitive headers
  (`Authorization`, `x-amz-security-token`) are redacted automatically.

- **Backpressure and streaming tuning** (V0.4-PERF-2): added configurable
  read/write buffer sizes, connection timeouts, and goroutine pool limits to
  prevent memory spikes under high concurrency.

- **Buffer pooling** (V0.4-PERF-1): implemented `sync.Pool`-backed byte buffer
  pools for AEAD chunk encryption/decryption, reducing GC pressure and
  allocation overhead on hot paths.

- **Enhanced Helm chart with TLS and monitoring** (V0.4-OPS-1): the Helm chart
  now supports TLS termination at the gateway pod via cert-manager certificates,
  Prometheus `ServiceMonitor` and `PodMonitor` resources, and configurable
  resource requests/limits.

- **Additional Helm chart knobs** (V0.4-OPS-2): exposed extra configuration
  values including replica count, HPA parameters, PodDisruptionBudget, topology
  spread constraints, and extra environment variables.

- **Load and regression test suite** (V0.4-QA-2): added a `k6`-based load
  test suite covering range GET, multipart upload, and concurrent PutObject
  scenarios with MinIO as the backend. Baseline results committed to repository.

- **Architecture Decision Records and diagrams** (V0.4-DOC-1): added exported
  architecture diagrams and ADR documents covering chunked encryption design,
  metadata compaction, multipart limitations, and range request handling.

- **Option to disable multipart uploads**: added `server.disable_multipart_uploads`
  config knob to completely block multipart uploads at the gateway layer, useful
  when maximum at-rest security is required and large-file uploads are not needed.

### Fixed

- Fixed `recordLatency` parameter types causing compilation errors.
- Fixed multipart upload route registration to ensure
  `?uploads` query parameter routes are matched before the generic PUT handler.

  handling to compute and forward correct `Content-Length` values to the backend,
  reducing compatibility issues with strict S3 implementations.

---

## [0.3.7] — 2025-11-04

### Fixed

- **Multipart upload route registration**: registered the multipart upload
  initiation route (`PUT /{bucket}/{key}?uploads`) before the generic
  `PUT /{bucket}/{key}` route to ensure correct handler dispatch when both

---

## [0.3.6] — 2025-11-04

### Added

- **TLS support for Helm Service and ServiceMonitor**: the Helm chart now
  supports configuring TLS for the gateway service endpoint and for
  Prometheus `ServiceMonitor` scrape connections.

---

## [0.3.5] — 2025-11-04

### Added

- **Helm NetworkPolicy egress for S3 backend**: enhanced the generated
  `NetworkPolicy` to include egress rules allowing the gateway pods to reach
  the configured S3 backend endpoint, preventing silent connectivity failures
  in strict network environments.

---

## [0.3.4] — 2025-11-04

### Added

- **Helm NetworkPolicy namespace isolation**: added namespace-scoped ingress
  rules to the generated `NetworkPolicy`, allowing operators to restrict which
  namespaces can reach the gateway.

---

## [0.3.1] — 2025-11-03

### Fixed

- **Signature V4 with client credential passthrough**: fixed a compatibility
  issue where using `use_client_credentials: true` in the backend configuration
  would break AWS Signature V4 request signing. The gateway now correctly
  passes through client-provided credentials for backend requests.

- Enhanced README with improved clarity and completeness.
- Updated roadmap milestone versions in `ROADMAP.md`.

---

## [0.3.0] — 2025-11-02

### Added

- **Client credentials in backend configuration**: added `use_client_credentials`
  configuration option allowing the gateway to forward the connecting client's
  AWS credentials directly to the backend S3 service instead of using a fixed
  service account. Enables transparent credential pass-through for multi-tenant
  deployments.

### Dependencies

- Updated Alpine base image from 3.20 to 3.22

---

## [0.2.0] — 2025-11-02

### Added

- **Chunked encryption for streaming and multipart uploads**: implemented
  AEAD chunked encryption that splits objects into fixed-size chunks (default
  64 KiB), each independently encrypted with AES-256-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305.
  Enables efficient range requests without full object decryption.

- **Optimised range requests for chunked encryption**: implemented range GET
  translation that maps plaintext byte ranges to the minimum required set of
  ciphertext chunks, decrypts only those chunks, and returns the requested
  plaintext slice. Documented in `docs/CHUNKED_ENCRYPTION.md`.

- **Optional `Content-Length` on `PutObject`**: the gateway now correctly
  handles `PutObject` requests with or without `Content-Length`, computing
  the encrypted output size when needed.

- **Initial Helm chart**: added a production-ready Helm chart for deploying
  the S3 Encryption Gateway on Kubernetes, including `Deployment`,
  `Service`, `ServiceAccount`, `ConfigMap`, `NetworkPolicy`, and optional
  `Ingress` resources.

- **GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows**: added workflows for Helm chart linting,
  testing (`helm/chart-testing-action`), and release (`helm/chart-releaser-action`).

- **Streaming and reduced buffering**: optimised the request proxy pipeline
  to stream request and response bodies where possible, reducing peak memory
  usage for large objects.

- **AAD binding and key rotation support**: bound Additional Authenticated
  Data (AAD) in AEAD operations to the object path, preventing ciphertext
  transplantation attacks. Added a key resolver interface enabling transparent
  read-side decryption with old keys while encrypting new objects with the
  current key.

- **Service account and network policy in Helm**: added Kubernetes
  `ServiceAccount` with optional IRSA/Workload Identity annotations and a
  `NetworkPolicy` restricting ingress to labeled sources.

### Fixed

- Stripped `x-amz-meta-` prefix before passing user metadata to the AWS
  SDK `PutObject` call to prevent `InvalidArgument` errors from backends
  that do not accept the prefix in the SDK input struct.

- Removed `MetaChunkCount` from the initial metadata write to prevent
  S3 rejection on `CreateMultipartUpload`; chunk count is now written only
  on `CompleteMultipartUpload`.

- Corrected `Range` header handling in `GetObject`, fixed header ordering,
  and returned the real ETag on `CopyObject` responses.

- Resolved a nil pointer panic in integration tests when Docker is
  unavailable.

---

## [0.1.0] — 2025-11-02

### Added

- **Initial release** of S3 Encryption Gateway.

- **Transparent AES-256-GCM encryption proxy**: a Go HTTP reverse proxy that
  encrypts objects on upload and decrypts on download, storing ciphertext on
  any S3-compatible backend without requiring client-side changes beyond
  pointing the S3 endpoint at the gateway.

- **ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher support**: alternative AEAD cipher selectable
  via configuration for environments where AES-NI hardware acceleration is
  unavailable.

- **Password-based key derivation**: PBKDF2-derived encryption keys from a
  master password, with per-object random IVs stored in object user metadata.

- **Phase 3 S3 API compatibility**: implemented `PutObject`, `GetObject`,
  `HeadObject`, `DeleteObject`, `DeleteObjects`, `CopyObject`,
  `ListObjectsV2`, `CreateMultipartUpload`, `UploadPart`,
  `CompleteMultipartUpload`, `AbortMultipartUpload`, and `ListParts`
  handlers.

- **TLS support and security hardening**: configurable TLS for the gateway
  listener with mutual TLS option; hardened HTTP server timeouts.

- **Configurable S3 provider support**: generic endpoint-based backend
  configuration compatible with AWS S3, MinIO, Garage, and any
  S3-compatible service.

- **Proxied bucket configuration**: per-bucket proxy configuration mapping
  gateway bucket names to backend bucket names with optional path-style
  addressing.

- **Request body size logging**: middleware capturing and logging request
  body sizes for observability.

- **MinIO integration test infrastructure**: test harness for running
  integration tests against a local MinIO instance.

- **MIT License**.
